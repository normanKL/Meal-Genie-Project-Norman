# Project: Meal Genie App

## What is the Meal Genie App? 

It is an app for meal recipes. The user can search the recipes by name or just use the recipes on our randomized recommendation. The user can also add the recipes he/ she likes to the favorite list (this is stored in local storage).

This app is deployed using Netlify and you can view the app [HERE](https://meal-genie-project-ga.netlify.app/)


## Technologies Used

React, Git, and GitHub

## 1) Planning 

This is a pair project. Ola and I discussed about the app features, user experience, pseudocode, and the challenges. We prepared the proposal on Excalidraw and listed down the important references and tasks in Trello.

 ## 2) Functionality

We created different routes for this app - Homepage, Random Meal Recipe, Find Recipe, and Favorite. The user can refer to the Random Meal Recipe or Find Recipe to prepare delicious meals for family or to spoil himself/ herself. If the user is a visual person, he/ she can also watch the videos embedded in the recipes.

The users can add their favorite recipes to the Favorite List (using local storage) and can check these recipes as and when they like.

## 3) Styling, DOM manipulation, and UX

We kept the styling simple and user-friendly. It is styled with 2 colors - white and orange.

## Blockers 
We learned this language for a week before this multi-page development project, therefore it was a learning journey for us to manage our time properly and to ensure proper communication which could be challenging because both of us are from different time zones. We also learned that we have many repeated codes but as we only had 2 days to complete this project, we decided to proceed to complete this project first and revamp it only after we submitted it.

## Bugs
We have fixed some bugs in the app and it works fine.

## Key Takeaways
It is important to list down all MVPs, pseudocode, and tasks in a proper manner.
I also wished that we could plan the layout of each route before we start the project and it's a lesson for my future multi-page development projects.
